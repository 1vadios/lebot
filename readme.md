# Lebot

Lebot is a irc bot built around analyzing Planetside 2 patches and updates.  It checks every 10 minutes for updates.  




### Notes
* This code is a mess.  i haven't touched it in 6-8 months
* There are many hard-coded references to channels. You'll have to fix them if you want to use it
* There is an intentional compile error in the main program.  I removed a password which will cause the bot to have issues.  You will need to fix it.
